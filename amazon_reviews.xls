Daring Departure: Samsung Galaxy Flip 5 Review - Unleashing Innovation While Navigating Quirks,,"As an avid iPhone user since the launch of the iPhone 6, I've always been drawn to sleek design, seamless user experience, and innovative features. However, the Samsung Galaxy Flip 5 has managed to break my iPhone loyalty with its extraordinary blend of cutting-edge technology and stunning aesthetics.

**Pros:**

**1. Striking Design:** Even as a devoted iPhone user, the design of the Samsung Galaxy Flip 5 left me in awe. Its foldable form factor is not only innovative but also practical, redefining how we perceive smartphone design.

**2. Dynamic 120Hz AMOLED Screen:** Coming from iPhones with traditional displays, the 120Hz AMOLED screen on the Flip 5 was an eye-opener. The fluidity of scrolling and the brilliance of colors truly set a new standard.

**3. Versatile Small Screen:** The small external screen is a revelation. It's the epitome of convenience for quick interactions like notifications, messages, and even staying connected on social media platforms. This feature has genuinely transformed the way I use my phone.

**4. Novelty Factor:** For someone who has been using iPhones for years, the Galaxy Flip 5 brings an air of novelty that's hard to ignore. Its futuristic foldable design sparks curiosity and admiration wherever you go.

**5. Abundant Customization Options:** The Galaxy Flip 5 understands the importance of personalization. With a myriad of customization choices, you can truly make this phone an extension of your personality.

**6. Impressive Selfie Camera:** Selfies have taken a new meaning with the Galaxy Flip 5. Using the main camera for selfies delivers exceptional results, capturing details and colors in ways I didn't think were possible.

**Cons:**

**1. Battery Power Could Be Enhanced:** Switching from iPhones, I found the Flip 5's battery life satisfactory for my moderate usage. However, I'd appreciate a more robust battery for those days when I'm on the move constantly.

**2. Camera Quality:** While the camera is far from disappointing, I couldn't help but expect a tad more from a device in this price range. A slight improvement in camera quality would be the cherry on top.

**Conclusion:**

Having been a loyal iPhone user since the launch of the iPhone 6, my switch to the Samsung Galaxy Flip 5 marks a significant departure from the familiar. Its exceptional design, immersive display, and versatility have managed to turn my head away from the iPhone allure. With a few enhancements, the Galaxy Flip 5 could be the ultimate device. Nevertheless, its remarkable fusion of style and functionality has made me realize that venturing into the world beyond iPhones can indeed be a rewarding experience. If you're ready to embrace innovation and redefine your smartphone journey, the Samsung Galaxy Flip 5 beckons.",Reviewed in India on 24 August 2023

"Amazing phone, headturner",,"The phone is amazing with breathtaking display and a real headturner whenever I get it out of my pocket. Battery is abit on the lower side, but works real well and morning charge stays till the evening.
Reducing stars due to pathetic amazon service and customer care. Prime delivery stated next day delivery, but, they delayed it by a day just because they didn't want to come to my location, the next day delivery came late at night and that too after multiple calls to customer care. Pathetic Prime service.",Reviewed in India on 10 November 2023

Pls chk mobile price at shop before ordering online,,"The phone is very attractive , yet to run its max capacity, price at mobile shop is 1,51,000",Reviewed in India on 15 January 2024
Great hardware. Outer screen somewhat limited.,,"Great build quality. Compared heavily between this and the Moto RAZR Ultra (in store also!), but the more durable screen on the samsung won. (See the YouTube comparison video). Plus Moto being a Chinese company also factored in.

Battery lasts 2 days for me, so no complaints there.

Only limitation is the limited apps supported on the outer screen (WhatsApp, YouTube, maps, messages), in addition to preset widgets. But hopefully with a software update we should be seeing more (eg podcast, running, music apps).

All in all solid hardware and software so far.

Update 1: Goodlock lets you add apps to the outer screen. Now perfect - updating to 5 stars (in spite of the additional steps involved to figure this out!).",Reviewed in India on 30 August 2023

Switched from iPhone,,"The quality is top notch no doubt, its worth lakhs! I bought it for 1.38l after using sbi card discount. Being a iPhone user since 6, I just dreamed of having this phone. Camers quality specially front could have been better since this is flagship phone.",Reviewed in India on 21 September 2023
Buy at your own risk,,"Play Video
This phone is not for daily usage. I moved to this phone after using one plus 7T for 5 years. This phone after 5 months of usage, developed lines across the fold, the lower half of the phone became darker in tone and the same lower half started flickering while playing any media (as you can see in the video). The phone might have fallen once, max twice from what i can remember, and these faults on the phone developed later and not instantly after any fall. When i took the phone to the Samsung service center they started looking for reasons to put the blame of faulty screen on me, as you can see in the pics, the phone has no visible damage or dents, but they started finding microscopic dents on the device. eventually, even though the phone is only 5 months old, they quoted a price of 36800 for screen repair (one can surely get a pretty decent new phone in that price).

So buy this phone if you are ok with fragile built quality, if you are ok with being a guinea pig for this beta version of device by Samsung and if you are ok with frustrating after sales experience. I would recommend maybe buying S23 (or S24) instead if you are really looking for a Samsung device.",Reviewed in India on 29 January 2024

loving z fold 5,,"The screen is awesome, this has been my second fold phone . My last purchase was z fold 3. In comparison to it this is much lighter. You have to get use to the font screen for typing ,rest everything is normal. People do complain about battery which I agree it's a bit lower I could have expected an hour or so extra. But as frequently travel to office it keeps up till evening 5 pm with a battery life of 20%. I usually charge overnight and remove it around 9 am from the charging dock.",Reviewed in India on 23 August 2023
Razr40 ultra or z flip 5,,"It's nice just resolution of cover screen is a lot lower than main one and sometimes think should have baught razr 40 ultra but in terms of hardware and battery everything's is far better than raze 40 ultra
And I can't continue apps from main screen to cover one so only resolution of cover screen and the one I just told bothers me only not that much just wanted to tell",Reviewed in India on 10 October 2023
Very well packaged and delivered.,,"Product as expected, Samsung always delivers.
Amazing color.",Reviewed in India on 9 February 2024
"Good potential, but is it worth it?",,"Coming from IOS, life seems excited when I hands on this new Zflip5 and IT TOOK ME NO TIME TO REGRET MY DECISION.

After setup, this phone dropped 20% battery in just 1hour and even the slightest work (say after 5mins) on the cover display makes it evidently warm.

However, performance-viz, it does felt snappy but at the end of the day, all comes down to battery sustenance. If you’re spending 1L (almost) on phone with poor battery, camera (low light performance) and not sure when that super convenient (flashy) foldable screen goes broke, IT IS NOT WORTH.

If you are really into Samsung and cannot get out of this brand, I suggest to go for S23/S23+, else iPhone is THE BEST option and at much cheaper price tag.",Reviewed in India on 30 August 2023

I showed it to service center. They denied it. There is a very small scratch on metallic part. Not on screen anywhere. But they have got the excuse.

They didn't even put new screen guard.

Don't know where to go. I have been asked to pay 54000 rupees for having a new screen.",Reviewed in India on 10 January 2024
Worth buying,,I would recommend this phone. The way the build the flip is really awesome and they did not compromise on quality and looks good with the small display. Average battery life and the display looks awesome with 6.7 inch screen when opened. If you guys are looking for longer battery life then this is not the one for you. Gaming is awesome and for me battery comes for a day with moderate usage. camera quality seems to be average when compared to Iphone. Overall a decent phone. I dont complain at all.,Reviewed in India on 29 August 2023
Not worth the money,,"I have used One plus top models for the last 6 years, due to Flip changed to Samsung but the user friendly features that were there in Oneplus are all missing in this Samsung Flip5, its a very difficult phone to use. The small screen is almost rendered useless, for most of the functions you have no other choice but to open the phone to use it. even a simple task like taking Screen shots is so difficult, I truly miss the user friendly features of Oneplus. Samsung needs to learn a lot from this comparatively new companies or they may end up like Blackberry",Reviewed in India on 26 December 2023

The hinge in the phone.,,"Hi Everyone, Just wanted to share my feedback on my fold phone. Please note that I had not purchased this phone on Amazon - so no issues with Amazon platform or the sellers as such. Hope this is useful for most of you before you make a purchase of Samsung fold or flip series phones.

I had purchased fold 4 last year considering there were no hinge related issues of its predecessor phones. Though I had not used the inner screen extensively, (I would have hardly opened it 500 times overall) today the inner screen stopped working when opened completely. Half way through it works but when opened completely it does not. Checked with the Samsung service folks - they said this is a standard issue with the hinge and since it is outside the warrantly time period I have to pay 52500 for the replacement and there is no other solution for this. I researched online and found a lot of users face such issue after One UI 6.0 update - which unfortunately I had done in the past week. Now I am left with a 1.5 lakh partially working phone with a valuable lesson learnt.

Please note - I am sharing this feedback only with regard to the so called thoroughly tested phone hinge alone.",Reviewed in India on 28 March 2024

Pricing above 1.5 LAcs and durability is so pathetic despite only home use. Samsung care servify only repeats ""OUT OF WARRANTY"" slogan(Service ref- 1190172595) does nothing. Their servify extended care sales process was so pathetic that even croma sales guy could not complete the process after multiple events in 2-3 weekends including on the date of purchase. ONce payment done for servify in september 2022 that also was seemingly refunded(service person told today).

Black screen issues - zflip4/5,,"The phone lacks durability, don't believe Samsungs claim about open/close stats. You'll be lucky if screen survives the first year of use. Look up black screen on flip on YouTube, plenty of issues which are deliberately buried by Samsung.

Totally worth it. Enjoying the new form factors!,,"We prebooked both Flip and Fold 5. Traded in our S22 Ultra and I Phone 13 pro which brought the price down significantly along with pre booking offers. Got the phones delivered on 10th of August.
This is our 1st foldable form factors wrt phones. Till now we were using candybar phones.

PRO-
1)- Very handy when in folded form.
2)- Screen real estate is surreal. Unfold it and you will be greeted to a mini tab.
3)- Very good for multitasking.
4)- Blazing fast and non heating chipset. Throw any task to it, it performs buttersmooth.

CONS-
1)- Although z flip is very compact, fold is little thick. But still very easy to store in pocket when folded.
2)- Inner screen is still plastic and have to very careful while handling. Use only microfiber clothes to wipe. Don't use any cleaning liquid on the inner screen because once it seeps under the pre applied screen protector, it will start peeling off. Also keep the inner screen clean regularly since some dust and lint from the pocket always ends up inside.

To set facts straight i currently own the phone much within the guarantee period.

The phone's hinge would not open completely (180 degree) and when I took it to the service center they came back giving me an excuse saying that due to a minor blemish on the side of the phone they cannot replace or set the hinge right and this repair would be out of warranty. They are putting the blame for their bad design on the consumer and asking us to pay 35k to set the hinge right. The phone is still with the service center and once I receive it I shall post more photos of it. Am sure to take them to consumer court and also send this issue across to all big tech reviewers some of them my friends and ensure this gets across to the masses so that no one else suffers and gets cheated like me!!!!",Reviewed in India on 5 October 2023
CHEATING CUSTOMERS,,"Samsung Customers BEWARE

My friend purchased a Samsung Phone Model F72B1A Flip model worth 89999 on January 2023. Along with that he bought Samsung care+ plan worth ₹ 14999/-.
At the time of purchase og theis Samsung Care + plan the vendor told that all type of damages will be taken care of under this plan. My friend accidentally dropped the phone and the screen was damaged. He went to nearest SAMSUNG SERVICE to get the phone repaired, The Service Centre informed him that he had to pay another 12999 to replace the screen. When we contacted the customer care along with copy of Invoice atleast three people contacted me and all are giving contradictory statements. One said that we have not paid fully for the care+ plan, another said since it is bought with EMI they have not received the money, last one said there is a one time payment to activate Samsung care+ plan and it costs 12999/. He said that total cost to repair the phone is ₹30000/-
It means one has to pay ₹27998/- (14999+12999) to get a job done which worth ₹30000/.
The vendor never informed about such charges while making purchase. They are sure that not a single customer will buy this protection plan if they come to know that the protection plan will cost them more than 31% of the buying price of phone.

SO, MY DEAR FRIENDS I DONT HAVE DOUBT ABOUT SAMSUNG'S QUALITY

BUT HAVE SERIOUS DOUBTS ABOUT THEIR SO CALLED PROTECTION PLANS

"""Unfolding the Future: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 Redefines Smartphone Innovation!""",,"The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 is a remarkable piece of technology that pushes the boundaries of what a smartphone can be. As a long-time user of foldable phones and a tech enthusiast, I had high expectations for this latest installment in Samsung's Z Fold series. Here's my honest review after spending some quality time with the device.

Pros:

Stunning Display: The foldable AMOLED display is nothing short of breathtaking. Whether you're using it as a standard smartphone or unfolding it for a tablet-like experience, the screen is crisp, vibrant, and responsive.

Performance Beast: Powered by the latest Snapdragon processor, the Z Fold 5 doesn't disappoint when it comes to performance. Multitasking, gaming, and handling intensive applications are a breeze. It offers a seamless experience that's hard to match.

Camera Flexibility: The camera system is impressive, delivering great results in various lighting conditions. The ability to use the same high-quality lenses for both standard and unfolded modes is a game-changer. It's a versatile tool for capturing memories.

Improved Durability: Samsung has made significant improvements in the durability department. The hinge feels sturdy, and the device exudes a premium, well-built feel. The display has seen improvements to its toughness, though I'd still advise using a screen protector.

S Pen Support: The addition of S Pen support is a welcome feature, making note-taking and creative work more accessible. The compatibility with Samsung's ecosystem is a plus for productivity.

Cons:

Weight and Size: The Z Fold 5 is undeniably heavy and bulky when unfolded. While this is expected from a device of this nature, it might not be suitable for those looking for a compact and lightweight smartphone.

Battery Life: Given the power-hungry hardware and the demanding screen, the battery life isn't as impressive as I'd hoped. You'll need to charge it daily with moderate to heavy usage. However, it supports fast charging for quick top-ups.

Price: As with previous iterations, the Z Fold 5 carries a premium price tag. It's a significant investment, and potential buyers should consider whether the unique foldable experience justifies the cost.

App Optimization: While app optimization for foldable screens has improved, not all apps are perfectly tailored for this unique form factor. Some might not fully utilize the screen real estate when unfolded.

In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 is a technological marvel that offers an exciting and unique user experience. If you're willing to overlook the weight, price, and battery life limitations, it's a solid choice. However, for the average consumer, it might be more practical to consider other flagship smartphones, as the foldable experience, while impressive, comes with its own set of trade-offs. Samsung has made notable improvements with this model, and I'm excited to see how the foldable smartphone landscape continues to evolve.",Reviewed in India on 26 October 2023
